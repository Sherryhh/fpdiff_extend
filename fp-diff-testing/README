========SETUP========

$docker build -t sp-diff-image .
$docker run -it --name=sp-diff-container sp-diff-image


========RUNNING THE CLASSIFICATION PIPELINE========

(Assuming cwd is /usr/local/src/fp-diff-testing/workspace)


1) To extract the function signatures from a directory of developer tests or header files for a library and generate drivers for the extracted functions:

    $python3 driverGenerator.py libraryName /path/to/directory


2) To divide the functions into equivalence classes:

    $python3 classify.py


========RUNNING TESTS========
    
    
Testing option 1)

To automatically run s3fp across all of the equivalence classes, first specify the desired s3fp settings in 
spFunDrivers/s3fpDrivers/s3fp_setting. Then, run the following command:

    $python3 s3fpTesting.py

NOTE: with a timeout setting of 100 SVE per test, processing time is about 1 hour. If you would like to have 
the docker container run the s3fp tests detached from the terminal and in a manner that won't be interrupted 
by a closed ssh connection, run the following command from the machine (not inside of the container):

    $docker exec sp-diff-container /bin/bash -c "python3 /usr/local/src/fp-diff-testing/workspace/s3fpTesting.py" &


Testing option 2) 

To run the functions in each equivalence class over adversarial special value inputs:

    $python3 adversarialTesting.py


Testing option 3)

To run the functions in each equivalence class over migrated test inputs:

    $python3 migrationTesting.py
